OpenMSP is a practical baseline for small MSPs and internal IT teams. It focuses on durability, clear handover, and the ability to exit any vendor at any time.

## Philosophy
- Open standards first (e.g. OIDC, S3, Postgres, Podman, KVM/QEMU).
- Vendor-agnostic, easy to migrate or self-host.
- Documented runbooks > magic.

- **Backups**: policies, verification jobs, restore drills.
- **Security baselines**: Windows/Linux/M365 hardening + patch cadence.
- **Ticketing flows**: generic workflows; example SLAs/OLAs.
- **Client-ready docs**: policy templates and comms.
- **Automation starters**: Ansible roles, Terraform/Kubernetes (k3s) examples.

**Status:** _In progress_ â€” public skeleton --- initial docs shipping soon.

_Interested in contributing?_ PRs welcome once the skeleton lands.
